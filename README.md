# CSE331: Software Design & Implementation
Prof. James Wilcox &amp; Kevin Zatloukal (SP '24)

Course Description: The goals of this course are teach students to:
- Reason accurately so that the code they write is likely to work correctly the first time it is run.
- Follow the accepted software engineering practices of reasoning, testing, and using the type system so that any reasoning mistakes are likely caught before a user sees them.
- Practice defensive programming so that they will likely catch any errors that make it past the reasoning, testing, and the type system.
- Understand the structure of larger-scale (client-server) programs so that they can effectively debug the failures do make it past those steps.
- Structure their programs so that they are easy to understand, easy to change, and modular.
